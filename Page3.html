                            interest in the New World. This tiny outpost quickly grew into a thriving hub of commerce

                            attracting traders, sailors, and settlers. Its harbor, rich in resources and geographically

                            in shaping its early destiny.

                            legendary for being equated to just $24 in modern currency. This moment wasn’t just a land
                            deal; it was the first
                            chapter in New York’s story as a city of ambition, negotiation, and transformation. From
                            these early cross-cultural
                            exchanges and mercantile ventures, the DNA of modern NYC began to take shape — diverse,
                            global, and built on
                            opportunity.
